      <h1>BEEF PILAU RECIPE</h1>

      <p>Pilau is a one-pot rice and meat dish that is fragrant, flavorful, and simply delicious. It is a popular dish in East Africa and is usually served both as a regular daily meal and as a special occasion dish such as at weddings. Pilau is commonly made with long-grain rice and beef, chicken, lamb, or mutton, a few vegetables, and a combination of ground or whole spices</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
       <ul>  
        <li>Basmati rice</li>
        <li>Pilau masala (or Garam masala)</li>
        <li>ground spices</li>
        <li>Ginger-garlic paste</li>
        <li>Red Onions</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Optional ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Tomato paste</li>
        <li>Beef masala and ground black pepper</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><p> Prepare and set up all ingredients at the beginning – wash and cut the meat into small pieces, chop the onions, grate or puree the tomatoes, and prepare fresh ginger-garlic paste. This will allow you to attend to each step well later without the need to prep or grab some ingredients from a distance. Woe unto you if you cannot find that garlic and the onions are already browning!</p></li>
        <li><p>Rinse and soak rice for 20 minutes. Soaking cuts down on cooking time and the rice will cook evenly and perfectly. Soak it at the beginning or after you’ve started boiling the beef. If twenty minutes elapse before its time to add rice to the pot, just drain the water and set the rice aside.</p></li>
        <li><p>Place beef in a pot. Sprinkle beef masala and black pepper onto it (optional) and add half a cup of water. Cover and cook on medium-low heat until the meat is tender. I do this for about 25 minutes. If there is any stock in the pot by the time the meat is done cooking, separate it from the meat for a later step. That stock does a really awesome job adding flavor to the pilau. I never let the meat dry up completely. If it accidentally does, I add a quarter cup of water just to get that stock</p></li>
        <li><p>In a deep pot, heat a quarter cup of oil on medium-high. Fry the onions until they just begin to brown. Add the ginger-garlic paste and continue frying for about half a minute, until the combination browns just a little more. Add the meat and fry for a few minutes until it begins to brown too. Note that the onions will continue browning with the meat, so you do not want them too brown before adding meat or they will burn and turn bitter.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add Pilau masala (or garam masala) and salt and fry for another half or a full minute to bloom the aroma of the masala.</p></li>
        <li><p> Add tomatoes and cook for about two minutes to allow the tomatoes to thicken. Then, add any stock from the boiled meat, and three cups of water to the pot. Stir, cover, and bring to a gentle boil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Add rice to the pot and stir gently. Cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until all the liquid dries up.</p></li>
        <li><p>Turn the heat off and leave the pot covered. Let it stand for a minimum of 5 minutes to allow any lingering moisture to be absorbed.</p></li>
        <li><p>Fluff gently to evenly distribute meat and rice.</p></li>
        <li><p>Serve with Kachumbari (onion-tomato-cilantro salad) and enjoy with a cold drink.</p></li>
